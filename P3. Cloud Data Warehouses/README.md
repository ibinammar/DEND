# Datawarehouse Project
Sparkify is a music streaming startup with a growing user base and song database.

Their user activity and songs metadata data resides in json files in S3. The goal of the project is to build an ETL pipeline that will extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
## Project Purpose

Help analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.
