# Data Engineering Nanodegree

## Data Modeling

Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

### Introduction to Data Modeling
In this lesson, students will learn the basic difference between relational and non-relational databases, and how each type of database fits the diverse needs of data consumers.

### Relational Data Models
In this lesson, students understand the purpose of data modeling, the strengths and weaknesses of relational databases, and create schemas and tables in Postgres

- **Project:** [Data Modeling with Postgres](https://github.com/ibinammar/DEND/tree/master/P1.%20Data%20Modeling%20with%20Postgres)
  - Students will model user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app. They will define       Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables.

### NoSQL Data Models
Students will understand when to use non-relational databases based on the data business needs, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to creates tables in Apache Cassandra.

- **Project:** Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
  - Students will model event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app. They will define queries     and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.

## Cloud Data Warehouses
- **Project:** Data Warehouse
